A transient &lt;i&gt;inhibition&lt;/i&gt; of the autocatalytic pathway at the outset of the reaction implicates an interaction between initiator and product initially formed in the uncatalyzed background reaction. Selectivity in formation of the product-initiator complex ultimately induces a slight enantioenrichment in the active dimer catalysts that trigger and direct the autocatalytic pathway.&lt;br&gt;</jats:p>",
